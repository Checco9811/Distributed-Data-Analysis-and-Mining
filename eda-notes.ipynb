    "## Finish Placement Prediction\n",
    "In a PUBG game, up to 100 players start in each match (matchId). Players can be on teams (groupId) which get ranked at the end of the game (winPlacePerc) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. In game, players can pick up different munitions, revive downed-but-not-out (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that __each row contains one player's post-game stats__. The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 player per group.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must __learn a model which predicts players' finishing placement__ based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Competition Description\n",
    "Battle Royale-style video games have taken the world by storm. 100 players are dropped onto an island empty-handed and must explore, scavenge, and eliminate other players until only one is left standing, all while the play zone continues to shrink.\n",
    "PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds (PUBG) has enjoyed massive popularity. With over 50 million copies sold, it's the fifth best selling game of all time, and has millions of active monthly players.\n",
    "The team at PUBG has made official game data available for the public to explore and scavenge outside of \"The Blue Circle.\" This competition is not an official or affiliated PUBG site - Kaggle collected data made possible through the PUBG Developer API.\n",
    "You are given over 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets, and asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings.\n",
    "What's the best strategy to win in PUBG? Should you sit in one spot and hide your way into victory, or do you need to be the top shot? Let's let the data do the talking!"

    "## Game Description\n",
    "Battlegrounds is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps, with areas of approximately 8 × 8 kilometres (5.0 × 5.0 mi), 6 × 6 kilometres (3.7 × 3.7 mi), and 4 × 4 kilometres (2.5 × 2.5 mi) in size. The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment. Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well. Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time. This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters. During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area. In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them time to relocate to safety.A plane will fly over various parts of the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot package, containing items which are typically unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke, drawing interested players near it and creating further confrontations. On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance. The currency is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon customization. A rotating \"event mode\" was added to the game in March 2018. These events change up the normal game rules, such as establishing larger teams or squads, or altering the distribution of weapons and armor across the game map. \n",

    "## Data Description Details\n",
    "This game is simple. Pick up your weapons, walk around, kill enemies and survive until the end. So if you look at the variables, kill and ride will come out and if you stay alive you will win.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Id__: unique identifier of a single player, which can partecipate or not in a team.\n",
    "2. __groupId__: ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n",
    "3. __matchID__: ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "4. __assists__ : the assists means that i don't kill enemy but help kill enemy. So when you look at the variable, there is also a kill. In other words, if I kill the enemy? kill +1. but if I did not kill the enemy but helped kill the enemy?assists + 1.\n",
    "5. __boosts__: number of boost items used. Both 'boosts' and 'heals' variables are items that restore health. But the boosts immediately show the effect, and the heals show the effect slowly.\n",
    "6. __damageDealt__: total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted. If it is not headshot, it does not die in one shot. So restores health by using boosts or heals. 'damageDealt' means how many bullets have ever been hit.\n",
    "7. __DBNOs__: number of enemy players knocked. DBNOs variable means Number of enemy players knocked. Knocked is not dead, but can not act. so if you are knocked, your colleagues can save you (revives variable) but if you died? you don't save... :(\n",
    "8. __headshotKills__: number of enemy players head-shotted's. It means that a bullet hit his head and he died right away. It's important that he died right away.\n",
    "9. __heals__: number of healing items used. See difference with 'boots'.\n",
    "10. __killPlace__: ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n",
    "11. __killPoints__: kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n",
    "12. __kills__: number of enemy players killed.\n",
    "13. __killStreaks__: max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n",
    "14. __longestKill__:longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n",
    "15. __matchDuration__: duration of whole single/teammate match in seconds.\n",
    "16. __matchType__: string identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n",
    "17. __maxPlace__: worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n",
    "18. __numGroups__: number of groups we have data for in the match\n",
    "19. __rankPoints__: Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n",
    "20. __revives__: number of times this player revived teammates. I said above, if you knock, your teammates can save you. If a team member is saved, the revives are +1.\n",
    "21. __rideDistance__: total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters. The PUBG game is so wide that it is hard to walk around.\n",
    "22. __roadKills__: number of kills while in a vehicle (it's hard to kill if you're in a car).\n",
    "23. __swimDistance__: total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters. The map is wide, and there are some kind of river.\n",
    "24. __teamKills__: number of times this player killed a teammate.\n",
    "25. __vehicleDestroys__: number of vehicles destroyed. We will rarely destroy a vehicle. In fact, it is very natural. It is difficult to destroy the car. And there is no profit by destroying the car. Even so, the destruction of a car can be thought of in the following sense: the enemy was in the car and shot the car, he hid the car in cover and shot the car or he broke a car with no meaning (strange players).\n",
    "26. __walkDistance__: total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n",
    "27. __weaponsAcquired__: number of weapons picked up. This game is a using gun , but it does not give a gun from the beginning. So you have to go around the map and look for weapons. In the process, you can also have heals, boosts and vehicles.\n",
    "28. __winPoints__: win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Label\n",
    "29. __winPlacePerc__: the target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.\n",
